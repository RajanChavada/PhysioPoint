# References – Domain & Problem Space (Rehab)

Context sources around rehab, motion capture, and cost/access gaps.

## Rehab & Motion Capture

- Developing an iOS AR application for guided recovery exercises (ARKit physio case study)[web:150]
- Smartphone-based markerless motion capture for knee/hip ROM measurement[web:153][web:156]
- Commercial platforms (Areno, Kemtai) using AI for home physio[web:151][web:154]

## Access & Cost Context

- Typical physio sessions costing ~$100 per visit (general market references; not a fixed rate).
- Real-world pattern: under-insured or elderly patients relying on YouTube instead of structured rehab (informal but common; based on owner’s family experience).

Keep in mind:
- PhysioPoint must **not** claim clinical equivalence to professional rehab.
- All numeric examples (angles, reps) are illustrative, not prescriptive.
