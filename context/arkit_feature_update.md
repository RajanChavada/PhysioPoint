Now I have the full picture. The fix requires three interlocking pieces: (1) exercise-specific live cue logic in the Coordinator, (2) a SessionFeedback model that accumulates what actually happened during the session, and (3) a new PTFeedbackCard in SummaryView that shows one positive + one actionable.
​

Here's the complete implementation across all three files.

Part 1: SessionFeedback model — new file
This is the bridge between the AR session and SummaryView. It records what actually happened so the summary can speak specifically about it.

```swift
// MARK: - SessionFeedback.swift
// Accumulates exercise-specific events during a session.
// Passed from RehabSessionViewModel → SessionMetrics → SummaryView.

public struct SessionFeedback {
    // What the user did well (picked at session end)
    public var positiveObservation: String = ""
    // What they should work on next time
    public var growthObservation: String = ""
    // Recovery journey message tied to the positive
    public var journeyMessage: String = ""
}

// Fired from Coordinator into ViewModel as events occur
public enum SessionEvent {
    case goodFormHeld(seconds: Double)         // spent ≥2s in zone continuously
    case cheatDetected(jointName: String)      // secondary joint deviated
    case rangeImproving(percent: Double)       // best angle > previous best
    case consistentMovement                    // low jitter across session
    case roughMovement                         // high jitter
    case fullRangeReached                      // hit upper bound of targetRange
    case rangeShort(gapDegrees: Double)        // never reached target upper bound
}
```
Part 2: RehabSessionViewModel — add event log + feedback generation
Add event tracking and the feedback generator that SummaryView reads at the end.

```swift
public class RehabSessionViewModel: ObservableObject {
    // --- existing published properties unchanged ---
    @Published public var currentAngle: Double = 0
    @Published public var repsCompleted: Int = 0
    @Published public var isInZone: Bool = false
    @Published public var feedbackMessage: String = "Position yourself in frame"
    @Published public var formCueText: String = ""
    @Published public var trackingQuality: String = "Initializing..."
    @Published public var cameraHint: String = ""
    @Published public var reliabilityBadge: String = ""
    @Published public var isBodyDetected: Bool = false
    @Published public var bestAngle: Double = 0
    @Published public var angleZone: AngleZone = .aboveTarget
    @Published public var debugText: String = "Initializing..."
    @Published public var targetAngle: Double = 90
    @Published public var tolerance: Double = 15
    @Published public var isTrackingQualityGood: Bool = true

    @Published public var totalFrames: Int = 0
    @Published public var framesInGoodForm: Int = 0
    @Published public var goodFormSeconds: Double = 0
    @Published public var jitterAccumulated: Double = 0

    // --- NEW: event log ---
    public private(set) var sessionEvents: [SessionEvent] = []
    // Tracks what exercise was running (set by ExerciseARView.onAppear)
    public var exerciseName: String = ""

    private var consecutiveGoodFrames: Int = 0
    private var goodFormStreakReported: Bool = false  // avoid spamming the same event
    private var cheatJointsDetected: Set<String> = []
    private var lastRawAngle: Double?
    private let framesPerSecond: Double = 30.0
    private let angleSmoother = AngleSmoother(windowSize: 5)
    public var engine: RehabEngine

    public var qualityScore: Double {
        guard totalFrames > 0 else { return 0 }
        return Double(framesInGoodForm) / Double(totalFrames)
    }

    public var controlRating: Double {
        guard totalFrames > 1 else { return 1.0 }
        let avgJitter = jitterAccumulated / Double(totalFrames - 1)
        return max(0, min(1, 1.0 - avgJitter / 15.0))
    }

    public var controlLabel: String {
        switch controlRating {
        case 0.8...: return "Excellent"
        case 0.6..<0.8: return "Good"
        case 0.4..<0.6: return "Fair"
        default: return "Keep going"
        }
    }

    public init(engine: RehabEngine = SimpleRehabEngine()) {
        self.engine = engine
    }

    public func setup(targetAngle: Double, tolerance: Double, holdTime: TimeInterval,
                      repDirection: RepDirection = .increasing, restAngle: Double = 90.0) {
        self.engine = SimpleRehabEngine(
            targetAngle: targetAngle, tolerance: tolerance,
            requiredHoldTime: holdTime, repDirection: repDirection, restAngle: restAngle
        )
    }

    // Called by Coordinator when a secondary joint cheat is detected
    public func recordCheat(jointName: String) {
        guard !cheatJointsDetected.contains(jointName) else { return }
        cheatJointsDetected.insert(jointName)
        sessionEvents.append(.cheatDetected(jointName: jointName))
    }

            // Record a "held good form" event once per streak ≥ 2s
            let streak = Double(consecutiveGoodFrames) / framesPerSecond
            if streak >= 2.0 && !goodFormStreakReported {
                goodFormStreakReported = true
                sessionEvents.append(.goodFormHeld(seconds: streak))

        } else {

Part 3: Coordinator — call recordCheat when secondary joint fires
In selectFormCue, when a cheat is detected, also tell the ViewModel so it gets logged:

```swift
func selectFormCue(
    primaryZone: AngleZone,
    config: JointTrackingConfig,
    skeleton: ARSkeleton3D
) -> String? {
    let cues = config.formCues
    guard !cues.isEmpty else { return nil }

    for cue in cues {
        guard
            let watchJoint = cue.jointToWatch,
            let maxDev = cue.maxAngleDeviation,
            let watchIdx = jointIndexMap[watchJoint],
            watchIdx < skeleton.jointModelTransforms.count
        else { continue }

        let watchWorldM = skeleton.jointModelTransforms[watchIdx]
        let deviation = abs(Double(watchWorldM.columns.3.y))
        if deviation > maxDev / 100.0 {
            // ← NEW: log it so the summary can reference it specifically
            viewModel.recordCheat(jointName: watchJoint)
            return cue.description
        }
    }

    if let zoneCue = cues.first(where: { $0.zone == primaryZone }) {
        return zoneCue.description
    }

    return cues.first?.description
}
```
Part 4: ExerciseARView — pass exercise name + generate feedback on Finish
In onAppear, set the exercise name on the ViewModel. In the Finish button, call generateFeedback and pass it into SessionMetrics:

```swift
// In onAppear:
viewModel.exerciseName = appState.selectedExercise?.name ?? ""

// In Finish button action — replace existing latestMetrics assignment:
let exerciseName = appState.selectedExercise?.name ?? ""
let targetRange = appState.selectedExercise?.targetAngleRange ?? 80...95
let feedback = viewModel.generateFeedback(for: exerciseName, targetRange: targetRange)

appState.latestMetrics = SessionMetrics(
    bestAngle: viewModel.bestAngle,
    repsCompleted: viewModel.repsCompleted,
    targetReps: appState.selectedExercise?.reps ?? 3,
    targetAngleLow: targetRange.lowerBound,
    targetAngleHigh: targetRange.upperBound,
    timeInGoodForm: viewModel.goodFormSeconds,
    repResults: repResults,
    previousBestAngle: 88,
    previousTimeInForm: 13,
    todayCompleted: 1,
    todayTotal: 3,
    sessionFeedback: feedback    // ← pass through
)
```
Add sessionFeedback: SessionFeedback = SessionFeedback() to SessionMetrics.

Part 5: SummaryView — new PTFeedbackCard
Replace repConsistencyCard (currently EmptyView) with this. Place it right after statsCard:

```swift

                    .fill(Color.orange.opacity(0.12))
                    .frame(width: 36, height: 36)
                Image(systemName: "arrow.up.circle.fill")
                    .foregroundColor(.orange)
                    .font(.system(size: 18))
            }

            VStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: 4) {
                Text("Focus for next time")
                    .font(.caption)

                    .foregroundColor(.primary)
                    .lineSpacing(3)
            }
        }

        Divider().opacity(0.4)

        // ── Journey message ──
        HStack(alignment: .top, spacing: 10) {
            Image(systemName: "chart.line.uptrend.xyaxis")

                .font(.subheadline)
            Text(metrics.sessionFeedback.journeyMessage)
                .font(.system(size: 13))
                .foregroundColor(.secondary)
                .lineSpacing(3)
                .italic()
        }
    }
    .padding(16)
    .physioGlass(.card)
    .opacity(animateCards ? 1 : 0)
    .offset(y: animateCards ? 0 : 20)
}
```
Then in body, insert it in the scroll stack:

```swift
VStack(spacing: 20) {
    heroSection
    statsCard
    ptFeedbackCard      // ← replaces EmptyView repConsistencyCard
    vsLastSessionCard
    bottomRow
    feelingResponseCard
    streakAndNextSection
    disclaimerText
}
```
What this produces, end-to-end
What fired during the session	Positive shown in SummaryView	Growth shown in SummaryView	Journey message
Hit full range + held form	"You reached your full target range AND held good form for multiple seconds."	"Keep the same controlled pace next session."	"3× per week → measurable knee strength in 2–3 weeks."
Good form held but short of range	"You held steady in the target zone — that controlled hold time builds real strength."	"You were 18° short of full extension — try holding at max for 2 extra seconds."	"Consistent sessions drive tissue healing. You're on the right track."
Back compensation detected	"Over half your session was in good form."	"Your back shifted — focus on keeping your spine still while the knee does the work."	"Even imperfect efforts help maintain circulation and prevent stiffness."
Rough/jittery movement	"You showed up and did the work."	"Try slowing the movement down — smoother reps build more tissue strength."	"Every session reintroduces safe load to the joint."
